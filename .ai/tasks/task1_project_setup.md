## Description

Set up the development environment with modern frontend tools and establish project structure for the multi-brand e-commerce platform with AR capabilities.

## Details

- Initialize project with React + TypeScript or Vue.js + TypeScript (choose based on team preference)
- Set up build tools (Vite or Webpack for fast development)
- Configure package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm)
- Install and configure essential dependencies:
  - CSS framework or utility library (Tailwind CSS recommended)
  - State management solution (Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or Pinia)
  - Routing library (React Router or Vue Router)
  - HTTP client (Axios or Fetch API wrapper)
  - Icon library (Heroicons, Lucide, or similar)
  - Image optimization library
- Set up development tools:
  - ESLint and Prettier for code quality
  - TypeScript configuration
  - Git hooks with Husky (optional)
- Create basic folder structure:
  - `/src/components` - Reusable UI components
  - `/src/pages` - Page components
  - `/src/hooks` - Custom hooks (React) or composables (Vue)
  - `/src/store` - State management
  - `/src/utils` - Utility functions
  - `/src/types` - TypeScript type definitions
  - `/src/assets` - Static assets (images, fonts)
  - `/src/styles` - Global styles and themes
- Configure environment variables setup
- Set up mock data structure for products, brands, and categories

## Test Strategy

- Verify project builds successfully without errors
- Run development server and confirm it loads on localhost
- Test hot reload functionality works properly
- Verify TypeScript compilation and type checking
- Ensure ESLint and Prettier configurations are working
- Confirm all essential dependencies are installed and importable
- Test environment variable loading
