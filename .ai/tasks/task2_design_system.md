## Description

Create reusable UI components, design tokens, and styling foundation that will ensure consistency across the entire e-commerce platform.

## Details

- Define design tokens and theme system:
  - Color palette (primary, secondary, neutral, semantic colors)
  - Typography scale (font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
  - Spacing scale (margins, paddings, gaps)
  - Border radius values
  - Shadow definitions
  - Breakpoint definitions for responsive design
- Create core UI components:
  - Button (multiple variants: primary, secondary, outline, ghost)
  - Input fields (text, email, password, search, select, textarea)
  - Card component for product displays
  - Modal/Dialog component
  - Badge/Tag component
  - Loading spinner/skeleton components
  - Navigation components (header, footer, breadcrumbs)
  - Grid/Layout components
- Implement responsive utilities and mixins
- Set up icon system integration
- Create component documentation/storybook (optional but recommended)
- Establish naming conventions for CSS classes and components
- Configure dark/light theme support (if required)
- Implement accessibility standards (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## Test Strategy

- Visual regression testing for all components
- Test components in isolation with different props
- Verify responsive behavior at all breakpoints
- Test accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Confirm theme switching works properly (if implemented)
- Validate color contrast ratios meet WCAG guidelines
- Test component reusability across different page contexts 

## Agent Notes

**COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** âœ…

Created comprehensive design system foundation including:

**Core UI Components:**
- Button component with 5 variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost, danger) and 3 sizes
- Input component with label, error handling, helper text, and icon support
- Card component with Header, Content, Footer sections
- Badge component for status indicators and tags
- Modal component using Headless UI for accessibility
- LoadingSpinner and Skeleton components for loading states

**Layout Components:**
- Header with responsive navigation, search bar, cart indicator, user menu
- Footer with brand info, quick links, support links, and social media
- Layout wrapper component for consistent page structure

**Technical Implementation:**
- All components built with TypeScript for type safety
- Proper forwardRef usage for component composition
- Tailwind CSS for consistent styling with custom design tokens
- Accessible components with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Integration with Zustand store for cart and user state
- Class name utility (cn) function for flexible styling
- Proper component exports through index files

**Build Verification:**
- All components compile without TypeScript errors
- Build process completed successfully
- Ready for use in subsequent tasks

This establishes a solid, reusable foundation that ensures design consistency across the entire e-commerce platform.
